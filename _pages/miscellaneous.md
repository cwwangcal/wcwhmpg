    The land is the appointed remedy for whatever is false and fantastic in our culture. The continent we inhabit is to be physic and food for our mind, as well as our body. The land, with its tranquilizing, sanative influences, is to repair the errors of a scholastic and traditional education, and bring us into just relations with men and things.

### [1] Accelerating Meal-related Tasks through Batch Pre-processing and Parallelization

Having meals consists of the following sub-tasks:
1. Moving from my room to the kitchen, 2. Cooking (vegetables, meat, and rice), 3. Eating, 4. Washing (dishes, wok, etc.), 5. Moving back to the room,

where 2-4 dominate the time cost.

With batch pre-processing of the ingredients and parallelization of atomic operations (defrosting, cutting, heating, cooling, eating, washing, and walking), I have achieved about **5x speedup** on having meals, compared with the straightforward method I adopted the first time I cooked. My current personal best record is **16 minutes and 55 seconds**.
